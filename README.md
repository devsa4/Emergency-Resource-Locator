<h3>AI-POWERED EMERGENCY RESOURCE LOCATOR SYSTEM</h3>

Problem Statement:
During natural or man-made disasters such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, fires, or pandemics, access to timely and accurate information is a major challenge. With no updated information about nearby resources there is a strong need for an intelligent emergency response system that ensures life-saving information is accessible even during network failures.

Abstract:
The AI-Powered Emergency Resource Locator System is designed to assist people during disaster situations by providing quick access to nearby hospitals, shelters, food resources, and emergency services. A key feature of the application is its ability to function during partial or complete network outages using offline-first technologies such as cached maps and locally stored emergency data.
The platform also allows for volunteer registration, allowing people to contribute during emergencies. Live updates from authorities and verified volunteers help keep a consistent flow of information. 

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js+Express.js
Database: MongoDB andlLocal storage for offline data caching
AI & Intelligence Layer: AI-based resource recommendation and prioritization
NLP for user queries
APIs & Services: Maps and location services
Emergency alert and notification services
